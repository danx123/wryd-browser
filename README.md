WRYD Browser (Enterprise Edition)

WRYD (What Are You Doing) is an experimental, enterprise-oriented browser built as a derivative of Shrine Browser Lite, designed to explore a hybrid browser architecture using PySide6 (Qt for Python) and dual rendering engines.

WRYD is not a browser built from scratch. It is a curated, re-engineered evolution of Shrine Browser Lite, with selected features streamlined, redesigned, and optimized for a futuristic, cyberpunk-inspired experience.

🚀 Overview

WRYD focuses on:

Enterprise-grade framework and architecture

Hybrid browser engine experimentation

Clean, minimal, and futuristic UI (Cyberpunk / Neon theme)

Performance-oriented feature curation


The project is intentionally designed to spark curiosity:

> “How can a modern browser combine PySide6 with multiple web engines without chaos?”



WRYD is the answer to that question.

🏗 Architecture

WRYD is built on industry-grade technology:

Framework: PySide6 (Qt for Python)

Primary Engine: WebView2

Secondary Engine: Qt WebEngine

Architecture: Hybrid / Dual Engine (auto-managed)


Engine Responsibilities

WebView2

Default page rendering

Primary browsing engine


Qt WebEngine

Profile selector

Guest & Incognito logic

Download handler

Settings, history, bookmarks

Internal menus and advanced browser logic



Engine switching is not arbitrary. WRYD uses predefined logic to ensure stability and focus, preventing conflicts between engines.

🛡 Features

Hybrid browser engine (dual engine architecture)

Built-in ad blocker (Shield)

Hybrid engine toggle

Process monitor (cyberpunk-style system insight)

Dynamic, animated homepage

Cyberpunk Neon Blue theme (single theme)

Status bar enabled (sidebar intentionally disabled)


Curated / Disabled Features

To maintain WRYD’s identity as a super-lite enterprise experiment, several features from Shrine Browser Lite are intentionally disabled:

Extreme / Standard performance mode

Copilot features

Sidebar navigation system



---

🎨 Design Philosophy

WRYD adopts a futuristic cyberpunk aesthetic:

Neon blue color palette

Animated UI elements

Dynamic bookmarks

Interactive homepage with custom animations

Cyberpunk-inspired application icon


The design is intentional: WRYD is meant to feel alive, experimental, and different.

🧩 Relationship to Shrine Browser Lite

WRYD is a direct derivative of Shrine Browser Lite.

Conceptually, the relationship can be described as:

> Shrine Browser Lite → WRYD
(similar to Debian → Ubuntu)



WRYD inherits a mature, stable foundation while introducing its own philosophy, limitations, and experiments.

🔍 Final Note

WRYD is not trying to compete with mainstream browsers.

It exists to ask a question:

> “What happens when a mature Qt-based browser framework meets a hybrid engine philosophy?”



WRYD is that experiment.
